WORD WRAP ON:
Do not run these procedures/functions in your scripts, they are being converted over to reflection for the time being.
Once they are in reflection's Core folder, use them as much as you want.
Using a link to this folder will screw you over in the end because this folder WILL be removed. It is temporary.

Thanks,
Cstrike
